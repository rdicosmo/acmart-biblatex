This is a working space to develop proper biblatex support for the ACM article class (acmart).

The relevant files for the bibliography styles are the following:

- ACM-Reference-Format.bst : the official ACM BibTeX style
- acmnumeric.*             : the preliminary biblatex support shipped with acmart,
                             where it is called ACM-Reference-Format.{bbx,cbx,dbx},
                             and only supports numeric citation style.
- acmauthoryear.*          : the preliminary biblatex support for authoryear citation style

In order to test the biblatex implementations, comparing with the bibtex one, the following files are included:

- main-bibtex.tex        : sample document that uses bibtex for a journal like PACMPL
- main-acmnumeric.tex    : the same document, adapted to use the biblatex support included with the acmart standard distribution, that uses a numeric citation style
- main-acmauthoryear.tex : the same document, adapted to use the new acmauthoryear biblatex style

These files use the samplebody.tex and samble-base.bib files extracted from the official acmart distribution.

Typing make will compile all these files, making it easier to see the differences between the oroginal bibtex version and the new biblatex version.
