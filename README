This is a working space to develop proper biblatex support for the ACM article class (acmart).

The relevant files for the bibliography styles are the following:

- ACM-Reference-Format.bst : the official ACM BibTeX style
- acmnumeric.*             : the preliminary biblatex support shipped with acmart,
                             where it is called ACM-Reference-Format.{bbx,cbx,dbx},
                             and only supports numeric citation style.
- acmauthoryear.*          : the preliminary biblatex support for authoryear citation style

In order to test the biblatex implementations, comparing with the bibtex one, the following files are included:

- main-bibtex.tex : a sample document that uses bibtex for a journal like PACMPL
- main-acmnumeric.tex : the same document, adapted to use the biblatex support included with the acmart standard distribution, that uses a numeric citation style
- main-authoryear.tex : same as adapted to use the biblatex support included with the acmart standard distribution

Typing make, will compile all these files.
